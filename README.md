# Risk assessment for arbovirus introduction in South Africa (arbovirusSA)

> This is a collaborative space for learning about methods related to risk assessment for arbovirus introduction and invasion. This will feed into Zinhle's PhD project on dengue (and possibly other arboviruses) in South Africa.
