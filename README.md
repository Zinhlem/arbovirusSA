Zinhle's Personal arbovirusSA

# Risk assessment for arbovirus introduction in South Africa (arbovirusSA)

> This is a collaborative space for learning about methods related to risk assessment for arbovirus introduction and invasion. This will feed into Zinhle's PhD project on dengue (and possibly other arboviruses) in South Africa.


This project will use R to develop the codes. These codes can be run from an office or home desktop. 

Using mosquito and climate data we will develop mathematical models to estimate the change in mosquito populations at different temperatures, which will in turn be used to to model dengue transmission dynamics.

Input data: Climate data
            Mosquito population data
